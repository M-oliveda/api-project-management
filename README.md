# Qoop Technical Interview: Backend API Service

This project is the API backend service developed to complete a technical interview for the **qoop.ai company.**

To develop this project, I will use the following technologies:

- Python will be the programming language.
- FastAPI will be the backend framework to build the APIs.
- PostgreSQL will be the relational database, using the SQLAlchemy ORM.
- Python and FastAPI libraries.

Although this project was designed for a specific purpose, its code is under an **open-source software license.**

_All information presented in this project is fictitious and does not represent real (**valid**) data._

## API Functionality

This API allows users to sign up and subscribe to the platform (for a complete experience) to use a project management backend service to create projects, add team members, assign tasks, and track progress.

Full use of the platform is available _only_ to users with an active subscription. Non-subscribed users can register but cannot create or manage projects.
